=======================
Multiple instance regression by fitting mixture models
By Alessandro Perina and Sadegh Mohammadi

IDEA:
1- Map all the instances in all the bags in a different space by learning a LDA/CG/MM model
2- Fit a mixture model for each bag
3- Assign the target variable using distances between mixture models a-la Citation-KNN etc
